It provides training materials on version control, analysis, testing, and open and transparent communication with future users, and builds on Turing Institute case studies and workshops. The project is coordinated by the co-lead investigators, Kirstie Whitaker and Malvika Sharan, and hosted at GitHub. The Turing Way Community makes all of their materials publicly available under open source licenses. The process documents and data are made available under a CC BY license, software under an MIT license.
